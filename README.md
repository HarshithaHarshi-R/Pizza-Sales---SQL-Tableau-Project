### Findings:

Based on the findings from the analysis of the pizza sales data, several key insights emerge that provide a comprehensive understanding of the business performance. The total revenue generated is $817,860, with an average order value of $38.30. This figure indicates the average amount customers spend per order, highlighting the pricing dynamics and customer spending behavior.

A total of 49,574 pizzas were sold from 21,350 orders. The analysis reveals peak ordering hours between 11 AM - 2 PM, with the highest concentration of orders occurring from 12 PM to 1 PM and another peak observed in the evening from 5 PM to 7 PM. These insights into peak hours can inform staffing and inventory management strategies to optimize service during high-demand periods.

Analyzing the sales distribution by pizza category reveals that the Classic category stands out with the highest percentage of total sales at 26.91%, followed closely by Supreme (25.46%), Chicken (23.96%), and Veggie (23.68%). These percentages show clarity on customer preferences, guiding future marketing and menu development efforts toward the most popular choices.

Further insights into pizza sales by size indicate that large pizzas constitute the majority of sales, accounting for 45.89% of total sales and 375318 pizzas sold. Medium-sized pizzas followed at 30.49% of total sales and 249382 pizzas sold.  This breakdown indicates a clear preference among customers for larger pizza sizes, possibly influenced by group orders or promotional pricing strategies on larger-size pizzas.

The top 5 best-selling pizzas in terms of pizza sold include The Classic Deluxe Pizza, The Barbecue Chicken Pizza, The Hawaiian Pizza, The Pepperoni Pizza, and The Thai Chicken Pizza, reflecting the popularity of these flavors among customers. Conversely, the bottom 5 - sellers include The Brie Carre Pizza, The Mediterranean Pizza, The Calabrese Pizza, The Spinach Supreme Pizza, and The Soppressata Pizza, presenting opportunities for menu adjustments or targeted promotions to boost sales of less popular items.

In conclusion, these findings provide a comprehensive snapshot of the pizza restaurant's operational performance, sales trends, and customer preferences. Leveraging this data can drive strategic decisions to enhance revenue, optimize menu offerings, and improve customer satisfaction.
